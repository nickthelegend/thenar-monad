/**
 * The deadline, and what happens to the money at it.
 *
 * The protocol has two ways to open work and they are not the same offer.
 * `createTask` leaves `expiresAt` at zero, and a task that never expires can
 * never be closed — escrow enters and the only way out is a payout, so
 * whatever nobody earns stays in the contract. `createTaskUntil` sets a
 * deadline, after which the funder may call `closeTask` and take back what was
 * never drawn.
 *
 * The interface could not see either. It decoded a version-one Task, nine
 * fields where the deployed contract has eleven, so `expiresAt` and `closed`
 * were read past and dropped — which is how a closed task with nothing left in
 * it still carried a Run button. This is the funder's half of the same fix.
 *
 * The button appears only for the funder, only past the deadline, and only
 * while there is something to return. Those are the contract's own conditions;
 * showing it anywhere else would be offering a call that reverts.

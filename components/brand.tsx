/**
 * The Thenar mark.
 *
 * The thenar is the muscle at the base of the thumb — the one that makes a
 * hand able to oppose and grip at all. So the mark is a gripper on a post:
 * two opposed jaws on a yoke, with the datum line crossing them where a
 * measurement would be taken. The pivot is the only closed form in it, so the
 * mark reads as a machine rather than a letterform at small sizes, and it
 * survives at 16 px because every stroke is the same weight.

/**
 * Write lib/deployment.ts from forge's record of the Monad deploy.

 *   node scripts/apply-deploy.mjs
 *
 * Reads the newest record under contracts/broadcast/DeployMonad.s.sol/10143
 * whose every transaction has a successful receipt, and takes each address
 * from the CREATE that made it. Nothing is typed in by hand, so an address in
 * the app is an address a transaction created — the registry was wrong once
 * when it was copied from a terminal, and that is the guard.
 *
 * Not run-latest.json. On Monad, forge wrote a second record a minute after a
 * confirmed broadcast, simulated against an endpoint that had not caught up:
 * nonces five behind, predicted addresses that hold other contracts, and no
 * hashes or receipts at all — and it overwrote run-latest with it.

 * The protocol records each accepted run's hash as it happens, which proves
 * every episode is real and says nothing about the set. This commits one hash
 * over the whole set, so a buyer can check the corpus they downloaded is the
 * corpus that was sold, and prove any single episode belongs to it without
 * downloading the rest.
 *
 * Signed by the verifier key, because the contract will accept it from nobody
 * else: the party that decides what an episode is worth is the party that says
 * which episodes there were.

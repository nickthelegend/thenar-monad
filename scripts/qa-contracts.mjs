/**
 * Section F — the contract registry, checked against the chain it claims to read.
 *
 * /contracts asserts that every listed contract is deployed, holds what it says
 * it holds, and that the readings beside it are live. This confirms each of
 * those independently: the address is called directly, and the figure the page
 * printed has to match what the node returns.
 *
 *   node --import ./test/register.mjs scripts/qa-contracts.mjs [base]
 *
 * Ported from Fuji to Monad. The registry is imported rather than scraped: it
 * used to hold literal addresses a regex could lift out of the source, and now
 * reads them from lib/deployment.ts, so importing it is the only way to see the
 * addresses the page sees.

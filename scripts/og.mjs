/**
 * Draw the card a link to this project unfurls into, as a file.
 *
 * Generated here rather than by a route. The route convention built locally,
 * appeared in the routes manifest, and returned 404 on the deployed host with
 * and without a pinned runtime — so this stops depending on the convention
 * entirely and writes a plain PNG into public/, which is the one kind of asset
 * every host serves the same way.
 *
 * The figures are read from the chain at generation time and the card says so.
 * A share card is a snapshot by nature; what it must not do is imply the
 * numbers are live, or quote numbers nobody can check. Both are on the card:
 * the date they were true, and the contract they came from.
 *
 *   node --import ./test/register.mjs scripts/og.mjs
 *
 * The chain, the address and the ABI are the app's own — scripts/monad.mjs and
 * lib/abi.ts — so the card cannot describe a deployment the site is not
 * reading. It used to carry its own copies of all three, and every move of
 * chain meant finding them.

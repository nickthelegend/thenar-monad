/**
 * One task's corpus, for an agent, paid in the request that fetches it.
 *
 * The first answer is a 402 carrying two offers. One is x402's exact scheme on
 * Monad: a cent of USDC to the corpus treasury, as an EIP-3009 authorisation
 * the agent signs and the Monad facilitator submits and pays the gas for. The
 * other is AgentKit's: sign a challenge with the agent's wallet, and if World's
 * AgentBook maps that wallet to a verified human, the first few pulls are free.
 * An agent with no human behind it is not refused; it pays.
 *
 * Settlement happens only after the export below returns a success, so an
 * agent that pays for a task with nothing recorded is told 404 and charged
 * nothing. Every pull that succeeds is recorded, hashed, and logged to
 * SalesLog on Monad with that hash.

 * nonce and timestamps are regenerated per response, so without this every paid
 * retry fails as `extension_echo_mismatch`: the client echoes the nonce it was
 * handed and the server compares it with the one it has just minted. Leaving
 * them out of the echo comparison weakens nothing — AgentKit checks its own

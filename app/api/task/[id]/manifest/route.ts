 * What this task's corpus contains, and the proof for one episode of it.
 *
 * Two roots come back and they are not the same claim. `computed` is derived
 * here, right now, from the episodes this server would hand you. `committed`
 * is what the verifier put on chain. A buyer cares about the second and should
 * check it against the first — if they differ, the corpus has grown since it
 * was committed, or something is missing from what you are being served, and
 * the point of publishing both is that you do not have to take our word for
 * which.
 *
 * The proof is included so the check can be finished in a browser: leaf,
 * siblings, root, and no request back to us.

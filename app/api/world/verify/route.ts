/**
 * Turn a Selfie Check into a contributor.
 *
 * Two statements have to agree before anything is recorded: World's, that a
 * live human made this proof for this address, and the wallet's, that the
 * address wants it. Then the Monad side follows — the human is put on
 * CorpusShares' control list, which is what lets them hold the shares their
 * runs earn. It settles in under a second, so the answer carries it.
 *
 * The admission is reported, not assumed. If the contract refuses or Monad is
 * unreachable the proof still stands, and the response says the whitelist step
 * did not happen and why.

/**
 * The public read surface, described.
 *
 * Everything on this site is readable without a key, and until now the only
 * way to find out what was readable was to read the source or guess. That is
 * fine for a demo and useless to the buyer this project keeps claiming to be
 * built for: the argument is that a corpus can be checked without trusting us,
 * and an unlisted API is a thing you have to be told about.
 *
 * Only the routes that read are in here. The two that write — /api/verify and
 * /api/submitted — are part of the station's own flow, require a signature
 * chain that only the station assembles, and publishing them as an interface
 * would invite people to build against something that is not one.
 *
 * The addresses and thresholds are read from the same constants the running
 * code uses, so the document cannot drift from the deployment it describes.

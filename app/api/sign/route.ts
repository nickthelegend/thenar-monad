/**
 * The only place the verifier key is used.
 *
 * This runs as its own Railway service with no public domain, reachable only
 * from inside the project's private network. The service that serves the site
 * does not have the key at all, so an exploit that reaches the web container —
 * a bad dependency, a traversal, an SSRF — reaches a container that has
 * nothing to sign with.
 *
 * Isolation is only worth having if this is more than a signing oracle. A
 * process that signs whatever score it is handed gives an attacker who can
 * reach it exactly what the key gave them. So the task is read from the chain
 * here rather than accepted from the caller, par is derived from the task's own
 * difficulty, and the score is computed from the samples by this process. The
 * caller supplies a recording; it does not supply a number.
 *
 * Nothing is stored here. The corpus lives with the service that owns the
 * volume, which is the one thing this deliberately cannot reach.

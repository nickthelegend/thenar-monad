/**
 * @title AxonProtocolV2
 * @notice The data foundry for physical AI: funded task bounties, per-trajectory
 *         settlement, and policies that pay their contributors.
 *
 * The design decision that matters: `submitTrajectory` records the provenance
 * of a run AND transfers the operator's MON in the same call. Networks doing
 * this on a sequential L2 write a bare anchor and settle off chain because
 * per-run settlement is not affordable there. Here it is one call, and the
 * writes are almost entirely independent — different operators, different
 * tasks, one shared slot counter per task — which is the workload parallel
 * execution exists for.
 *
 * Scores are not self-reported. A run is only payable with an EIP-712
 * signature from the verifier key, which the backend produces after replaying
 * the trajectory. The operator cannot mint their own score.
 *
 * Three things changed from v1, each of which needed a redeploy because each
 * is a change to what the contract will accept:
 *
 *  1. `closeTask` returns unspent escrow to the funder once a task's deadline
 *     has passed. v1 had a `TaskClosed` error and no way to close anything:
 *     money committed to slots nobody filled could only leave through accepted
 *     runs, so a task nobody wanted was a permanent lock-up.
 *
 *  2. `submitTrajectoryFor` lets one address pay the gas for another's run.
 *     v1 credited `msg.sender`, so a relayer paying an operator's gas would
 *     have taken their payout with it. The verifier's signature already names
 *     the contributor, so relaying forges nothing — it only moves who pays.
 *
 *  3. The passkey path hashes what it verifies. v1 handed the raw trajectory
 *     hash to the P-256 precompile as the digest, but WebCrypto signs
 *     `sha256(message)`, so a browser passkey signed one value while the
 *     contract checked another and no signature could ever pass. Tested
 *     against the deployed v1: raw returns false, hashed returns true.

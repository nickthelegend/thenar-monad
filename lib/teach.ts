/**
 * Teach and repeat: the arm watches one run a person was paid for, then does
 * the task again on its own, wherever the payload starts and the goal is.
 *
 * A settled run is cut where the jaws closed on the payload and where they
 * opened again. Before the grasp the tool's path is held relative to where the
 * payload was; after the release, relative to the goal; in between it blends
 * from one to the other, and the offset turns with the anchor's bearing from
 * the base, so an approach from the arm's side stays one. Moving the payload
 * or the goal bends the demonstration rather than replaying it blind.
 *
 * A repeat is the robot's work, not a person's, so the station only ever runs
 * one as practice: it is never submitted, never paid, and never counted.

/**
 * The Monad testnet deployment, as contracts/script/DeployMonad.s.sol left it.
 *
 * Written by scripts/apply-deploy.mjs from forge's broadcast record, never by
 * hand, so an address here is an address a transaction created. Public on
 * purpose: every value is on chain already, and committing it means a fresh
 * checkout and the deployed site read the same contracts without either
 * needing an env file to agree.
 *
 * An empty address means not deployed yet, which every surface already knows
 * how to say.
 *
 * No imports: scripts load this file with Node, outside the Next build.

/**
 * Inverse kinematics for THENAR-6.
 *
 * The link lengths below are read off cad/arm.py — they are the same numbers
 * the GLB was generated from, converted to metres. Changing a dimension there
 * means changing it here; the arm and its solver are one part.
 *
 * The solve is analytic, not iterative: base yaw from the target azimuth, then
 * a planar two-link solve to the wrist centre, then a wrist pitch that returns
 * the tool to vertical. A closed form matters because the operator is driving
 * this at 60 fps and an iterative solver would visibly hunt.

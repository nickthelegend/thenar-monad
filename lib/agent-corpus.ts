/**
 * The terms on which an agent can take a task's corpus without a subscription.
 *
 * A CorpusAccess subscription is a wallet buying a day. That fits a person with
 * a browser and fits an agent badly: an agent wants one task's file, now, paid
 * for in the request that fetches it. So the same file is also sold per pull
 * over x402, in USDC on Monad, and an agent that can show a verified human
 * behind it in World's AgentBook gets its first pulls free.
 *
 * Monad is what makes a one-cent sale sensible: the agent signs an EIP-3009
 * authorisation, the facilitator submits it and pays the gas, and the transfer
 * is final in the block it lands in, under a second after the request.
 *
 * Shared by the route that enforces these terms and the pages that state them,
 * so the price on the page is the price the server asks for.
 *
 * No imports: scripts/agent-buy.mjs loads this file with Node.

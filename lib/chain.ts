/**
 * Monad testnet, where Thenar was first built at Monad Blitz Hyderabad.
 *
 * Four properties of this chain run through the product, and each one has a
 * place in the code that is shaped by it:
 *
 *  - Sub-second blocks. A run settles in the time it takes the station to say
 *    it was sent, which is why the station reports settlement latency at all.
 *  - Parallel execution. AxonProtocolV2 shards its slot counter so that two
 *    operators on one task do not write the same storage slot.
 *  - The P256 precompile at 0x0100. A browser passkey authorises a run and the
 *    chain checks the secp256r1 signature itself; see /passkey.
 *  - Gas charged on the limit, not on what is used. Every submit's gas limit
 *    is estimated rather than padded, and the station says what it cost.
 *
 * One constraint shapes the reads: the public endpoints answer `eth_getLogs`
 * only a hundred blocks wide, under a minute of chain. So history is read from
 * contract storage, and a transaction hash is found with a one-block query at
 * the block the contract recorded — see lib/hooks.ts.

 * The store, whichever one it is.

 * One SQLite file on a volume was enough while there was one writer and one

 * be the asset: a single file cannot be read by a second instance, cannot be
 * restored to a point in time, and puts the durability of every payout's
 * evidence on one disk staying attached.
 *
 * Postgres in production, SQLite in development. Not a fallback ladder — the
 * engine is chosen once by whether DATABASE_URL is set, and nothing silently
 * degrades from one to the other. A developer gets a file they can delete; a
 * deployment gets a database with its own backups.
 *
 * The two are kept behind one interface deliberately narrow enough to be
 * portable: parameterised statements with `?`, no engine-specific SQL above
 * this file. `?` is translated to `$n` for Postgres here, in the one place
 * that knows which engine it is talking to.

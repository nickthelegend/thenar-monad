/**
 * Read a log range without knowing what the endpoint will accept.
 *
 * Every log-reading path in this app has, at some point, encoded a guess about
 * how many blocks a single `getLogs` may span, and every guess has been wrong
 * in a way that took a surface down quietly.
 *
 * The first guess was two thousand, walked back forty times. That assumed a cap
 * far tighter than the primary endpoint enforces, and produced a window of
 * eighty thousand blocks — under two days on this chain — so the standings and
 * the feed went empty a week after the runs they read were recorded. Not with
 * an error: with a legitimate-looking nothing.
 *
 * The second guess was a million in one call, which the primary does answer.
 * But the secondaries this app now fails over to do not: publicnode refuses
 * above about fifty thousand and drpc above about ten. A failover under that
 * assumption swaps a dead endpoint for a live one that returns nothing.
 *
 * So there is no guess. Ask for the whole range; if the endpoint refuses, halve
 * it and ask again for both halves. The range is a property of the deployment's
 * history and the splitting is a property of whoever is answering, which is the
 * only division that survives changing either.
 *
 * The halves are asked for one after the other. They used to go out together,
 * which turned one refusal into a burst of hundreds of requests from
 * every open tab; the public endpoint answered with "rate limit exceeded" for
 * the whole machine, and every read that followed failed with it.

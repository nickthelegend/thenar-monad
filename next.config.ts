   * These have to be `beforeFiles` — the default `afterFiles` phase runs only
   * when nothing on the filesystem matched, and the API routes are on the
   * filesystem in both deployments, so they would answer locally and the proxy
   * would never fire. With BACKEND_ORIGIN unset the app serves its own API,

   * means a script injected into a page cannot quietly ship data somewhere else.
   * `unsafe-eval` is required by the WASM/three toolchain and `unsafe-inline`
